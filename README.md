# ✔️ :new: Welcome to ***My GitHub Hub*** :cool: ✔️

- Welcome to my *Hub* - there's some pretty neat stuff laying around here. 

- :information_desk_person: *Please*... allow me to give you a tour of the grounds. If you'll [follow me...](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/#a-cool-section) :information_desk_person:

## A Little Diddly on Edits and Commits
- 🕦 Take your time 🕦 ...we'll embark on the tour [shortly](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/#a-cool-section).
- Did you know... this whole page is written in Markdown (fancy, *right*? 👌)
- Whenever I want to edit it, I can just click on [this link](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/TheGreatBabushka/edit/main/README.md)
 (psssst... it only works if you've got the :lock: & :key: to this repository!)

- Also, whenever someone makes a commit, all of my web pages (both *.html* and *.md*) will automatically get rebuilt - *including* this one! Pretty cool, *huh*? 
Seriously now... [let's get on with that tour!](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/#a-cool-section)


## Flutter Web App
- Hey... you shouldn't be here... [why didn't you click on one of those 🦆-ing links I gave you earlier?!?!?! 🆗... Is this one big enough to click for you, Mr. Explorer?! Mr. "I dont want to click on normal links like a regular person". Will you click this one now!? I bet you didn't know that links could be so long, did you!? Well... they can! But my hand is cramping and i need a sip of ☕ now.... clickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk meeeeeeeeeeee plzzzz for the love of anything holy just clickkkkkkkkkkkkk meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee............](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/#a-cool-section))

- Wtf. Wellll, while you're heeeere... want to see my [demo flutter web app](https://thegreatbabushka.github.io/TheGreatBabushka) hosted on GitHub pages?

- You could also check out my [main webpage](https://thegreatbabushka.github.io/#/), which embeds that same flutter app in its HTML! 

- _Freakin' cool_, amiright?!

- Yeah i know, it's ugly an ugly little 🦆. I'll get to that CSS... one day. 

***But*** - that's not the point. The point is, it's *that* easy to embed Flutter apps into your web page! The possibilities are limitless!
