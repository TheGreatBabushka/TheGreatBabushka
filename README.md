# My GitHub Hub 

Welcome to my *Hub* - it's got some pretty neat stuff here...

Please, let me show you around. Now, if you'll [follow me...](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/#a-cool-section)

## A Little Diddly on Edits and Commits

Did you know... that if *I* want to edit this page, I can do so *easily* by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/TheGreatBabushka/edit/main/README.md)

(psssst... it only works if you've got the :lock: :key: to this repository)

Also, whenever someone makes a new commit, all of the pages in my site will automatically rebuilt - *including* this one! Pretty cool, _huh_? 

Seriously now... [to the next section!](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/TheGreatBabushka/main/README.md)


## Flutter Web App
Hey... you shouldn't be here... why didn't you [click on the stupid link I gave you?!?!?!](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/TheGreatBabushka/main/README.md)
Want to see my [demo flutter web app](https://thegreatbabushka.github.io/TheGreatBabushka) hosted on GitHub pages?


You could also check out my [main webpage](https://thegreatbabushka.github.io/#/), which embeds that same flutter app in its HTML!


_Freakin' cool_, amiright?!
