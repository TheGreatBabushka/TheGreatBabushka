# GitHub Hub - TheGreatBabushka

Welcome to my *Hub* - it's got some pretty neat stuff here...

Let me show you! If you'll [follow me](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/#a-cool-section)...

### A Little Diddly

Did you know... that if I want to edit this page, I can *easily* do so by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/TheGreatBabushka/edit/main/README.md)
(psssst... it only works if you've got the :key: :lock: to this repository)

Also, whenever someone makes a new commit, all of the pages in my site will automatically rebuild - including this one! Pretty cool, _huh_? 

Seriously now... [to the next section!](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/TheGreatBabushka/main/README.md)


### Flutter Web App
Want to see my [demo flutter web app](https://thegreatbabushka.github.io/TheGreatBabushka) hosted on GitHub pages?


You could also check out my [main webpage](https://thegreatbabushka.github.io/#/), which embeds that same flutter app in its HTML!


_Freakin' cool_, amiright?!

# A Cool Section
There's really cool stuff down here...

...trust me.
