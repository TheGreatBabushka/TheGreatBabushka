# ‚úîÔ∏è :new: ***My GitHub Hub*** :cool: ‚úîÔ∏è

Welcome to my *Hub* - there's some pretty neat stuff laying around here. 

:information_desk_person: Please, allow me to give you a tour of the grounds. :information_desk_person: 

Now, if you'll [follow me...](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/#a-cool-section)

## A Little Diddly on Edits and Commits

Did you know... if *I* want to edit this page, I can just click on [this link](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/TheGreatBabushka/edit/main/README.md)

(psssst... it only works if you've got the :lock: & :key: to this repository)

Also, whenever someone makes a new commit, all of the pages in my site will automatically rebuilt - *including* this one! Pretty cool, _huh_? 

Seriously now... [to the next section!](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/#a-cool-section)


## Flutter Web App
Hey... you shouldn't be here... [why didn't you click on one of those ü¶Ü-ing links I gave you earlier?!?!?! üÜó... Is this one big enough to click for you, Mr. Explorer?! Mr. "I dont want to click on normal links like a regular person". Will you click this one now? I bet you didn't know that links could be so long, did you?](https://github.com/TheGreatBabushka/#a-cool-section))

Wellll, while you're heeeere... want to see my [demo flutter web app](https://thegreatbabushka.github.io/TheGreatBabushka) hosted on GitHub pages?

You could also check out my [main webpage](https://thegreatbabushka.github.io/#/), which embeds that same flutter app in its HTML! 

_Freakin' cool_, amiright?!

Yeah i know, it's ugly an ugly little ü¶Ü. I'll get to that CSS... one day. 

***But*** - that's not the point. The point is, it's *that* easy to embed Flutter apps into your web page! The possibilities are limitless!


# A Cool Section
